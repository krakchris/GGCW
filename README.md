Creating a dashboard for the Glabal Green City Watch project as seen on www.globalgreencitywatch.org.

Using shiny-server and Rstudio this web application can be run on a digitalocean ubuntu droplet or on any other system running a shiny-server instance.
We use the leaflet package to visualize maps and R plotting tools for the scorecard. Clicking the circlemarkers will display specific information about the park, giving citizens and policymakers a comprehensive insight in their green space quality.

The current live version can be seen here:

The current version of the prototype is shown below:
