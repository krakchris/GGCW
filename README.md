# GGCW dashboarding

Creating a dashboard for the Glabal Green City Watch project as seen on www.globalgreencitywatch.org.

Using shiny-server and Rstudio the web application can be run on a digitalocean ubuntu droplet.
We use the leaflet package to visualize maps and R plotting tools for the scorecard.
